Self-awareness is a key skill for anyone working in collaborative environments, especially in tech. By understanding our own strengths, weaknesses, and triggers, we can communicate more effectively and respond to challenges thoughtfully.

This post discusses:

- **Practical exercises for self-awareness**: Journaling, reflection, and seeking feedback are simple ways to start.
