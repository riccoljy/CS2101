          <p>Welcome to <strong>From Code to Conversation</strong>, a blog dedicated to exploring the essential communication skills that can transform how you work and interact in the tech industry. This blog is a resource for developers, engineers, and tech enthusiasts who want to enhance their communication toolkit and navigate workplace interactions more effectively.</p>
          
          <h2>Why This Blog?</h2>
          <p>In tech, we often focus on coding skills, algorithms, and product features, but communication is just as critical to building effective teams and delivering successful projects. Here, we explore three key communication skills:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong> – Techniques for addressing disagreements constructively and finding solutions that benefit everyone.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Awareness</strong> – Recognizing your own communication style, emotions, and responses to improve how you engage with others.</li>
            <li><strong>Active Listening</strong> – Listening attentively to understand your team members' perspectives, a skill that builds trust and improves collaboration.</li>
          </ul>
